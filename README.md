# SN Ia Progenitor Z vs 56Ni Mass
## Kim et al. 

* See Kim et al. 2024, MNRAS, 529, 3806 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.529.3806K/abstract) for how to trace back the SN Ia progenitor star's birth environment.
 

 ## Table contais:

- 'sn': SN ID,

- 'host': Host galaxy name;

- 'zcmb': in CMB frame;

- 's2_x1', 's2_x1.err': SALT2.4 light-curve shape parameter and its error;

- 's2_hr', 's2_hr.err': SALT2.4 Hubble residulas (based on Omega_m = 0.3 and H0=70 assuming flat LCDM cosmoloy) and its error; 

- 'yeps_birth_feh', 'yeps_birth_feh_low', 'yeps_birth_feh_high': birth environment [Fe/H] of host galaxies and its errors (dex);

- 'yeps_birth_afe', 'yeps_birth_afe_low', 'yeps_birth_afe_high': birth environment [a/Fe] of host galaxies and its errors (dex);

- 'yeps_birth_z', 'yeps_birth_z_low', 'yeps_birth_z_high': birth environment total metallicity Z of host galaxies (~ progenitor star) and its errors (dex);

- 'scal19_ni_mass', 'scal19_ni_mass.err': derived 56Ni mass in the unit of solar mass
